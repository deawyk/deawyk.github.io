As a Data Analyst, our job is simply __to see__. Amongst the inordinate numbers of KPIs to track, my work has mostly been in identifying the disproportionately valuable ones which drive the most business impact. Usually they are also the ones that get the most pushback cross-departments. 
_"We can up the CTR, but not Offline Referral. We don't even track that." 
"That's too difficult!." 
"Impossible."_
When I hear things like these, it's usually a sign I'm onto something. 

I love my job because I get to learn from subject-matter experts, quiz them on their job until I understand just enough to start asking the right questions. The same questions are then translated and queried into the data. Data is like my solutions book. I spend most of my time iterating it, improving it incrementally, applying some creativity, and waiting for that _Aha_ moment when patterns start to appear for me and the knowledge finally sticks. 

It's not about moving stubborn numbers, ultimately, it is to help businesses grow.

A deep dive of codes is coming soon on [my github](https://github.com/deawyk). In the meantime, I've included a brief summary of the projects I've been working on.

### Portfolio Optimization
It began with building a simple script to automate my daily stock trading habits, a useful layman's tool. Research into Modern Portfolio Theory, Sharpe Ratio, etc., made it a project to compare the benefits and drawbacks of various investment strategies for individuals and organizations. No one likes an overfitted model, my focus has been in finding an optimized heuristic approach to investing. 

Mathematics has Occamâ€™s Razor Principle and I hope to prove the finance equivalent, after all, it is just numbers.

### Music Metrics
My colleague [Funto Dabiri]() and I are currently working on an NLP project compiling culturally relevant cities found in hip-hop lyrics throughout the decades. Our goal is to discover the impact soft power and pop culture have on economic development and vice-versa: how artists use their cities as the backdrop to secure loyal consumers. We look to quantify the impact art has in dollar value, and the influence emotions play in our purchasing choices and power. 

The shoulders of giants whom we stand upon: [pycmc](https://pypi.org/project/pycmc/)-python Chartmetric API client, [LyricsGenius](https://lyricsgenius.readthedoc.io/en/master/)-python client for the Genius.com API
