The job of a data analyst is simply _to see_. Amongst the inordinate numbers of KPIs to track, my work is to identify the disproportionately valuable ones which drive the greatest impact. Usually, they are the ones that get the most pushback cross-departments, and also the most difficult and stubborn KPIs to move. 

I love my work because I get to learn from subject-matter experts, quiz them on their job until I understand just enough to start asking the right questions. The same questions are then translated and queried into the data. 

Data is like my solutions book. I spend most of my time iterating, incrementally improving, and applying some creativity to it. Then comes that _Aha_ moment when the patterns start to surface and the knowledge finally sticks. Data is often the best and only solution to help businesses grow.



A deep dive of codes is coming soon on [my github](https://github.com/deawyk). In the meantime, I've included a brief summary of the projects I've been working on.

### Portfolio Optimization
I began building a simple script to automate my daily stock trading habits, a useful layman's tool. Deeper research into Modern Portfolio Theory, Sharpe Ratio, turned into a full-fledge project on the benefits and drawbacks of various investment strategies for individuals and organizations. 

No one likes an overfitted model, my focus has been in finding an optimized heuristic approach to investing. Mathematics has Occamâ€™s Razor Principle and I hope to prove the finance equivalent.

### Music Metrics
My colleague [Funto Dabiri]() and I are currently working on an NLP project compiling culturally relevant cities found in hip-hop lyrics throughout the decades. Our goal is to discover the impact soft power and pop culture have on economic development and vice-versa: how artists use their cities as the backdrop to secure loyal consumers. We look to quantify the impact art has in dollar value, and the influence emotions play in our purchasing choices and power. 

The shoulders of giants whom we stand upon: [pycmc](https://pypi.org/project/pycmc/)-python Chartmetric API client, [LyricsGenius](https://lyricsgenius.readthedoc.io/en/master/)-python client for Genius API
