### [Automated Trading System with APIs](https://github.com/deawyk/Automated-Trading-System-via-APIs/blob/main/automated%20trading%20tda%20api.py)
<div> A trading bot that trades stocks for you using the TD Ameritrade API in Python.
    - I used the [tda-api](https://pypi.org/project/tda-api/) for most trading actions. 
    - The stock the time interval you wish to trade at is determined by user input. 
    - Investment strategies can be altered according to personal desire. 
    - Here, I bought and sold stocks by setting an RSI threshold as the trigger([ta](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for financial ratios). 
    - I automated the process end-to-end by importing Selenium and Chrome Driver for automatic login.</div>
    
### [Customer Segmentation using K-Means](https://github.com/deawyk/Customer-Segmentation-via-KMeans)
<p>    **Customer segmentation and cohort analysis on real retail data using k-means clustering.** 
- I cleaned and explored over 525k records of retail data from an UK based online store over a one year period.
    - Behavioural analysis was conducted on cohorts, and metrics including average purchase value, customer value, CLV, were calculated and drew further insights. 
    - I took an heuristic approach to segmentation using RFM and compared those results to results from the definitive k-means algorithm (minimizes within cluster variances). 
    - Tellingly, the unsupervised machine learning output had almost 70% congruence to the heuristic approach.
    - The final deliverable was presented to a business-oriented audience, with most visualizations generated by matplotlib and seaborn. 
    - I also used [currency_converter](https://pypi.org/project/CurrencyConverter/) to dynamically convert prices based on the currency rate at the date of purchase.</p>

### [Google BigQuery ETL and KPI Dashboard](https://github.com/deawyk/Google-Analytics-KPIs-via-Google-BigQuery/blob/main/BigQuery%20Script.sql)
A high-level to granular dashboard in Tableau using data extracted via Google BigQuery's SQL-like queries from Google Analytics Sample data.
    I calculated the following metrics: Total Pageviews, Total Unique Pageviews, Total Entrances, Total Exits, Total Time on Page, Total Sessions, and Total Bounces.
    
### [Comprehensive Webscraping with Regex](https://github.com/deawyk/Webscraping-Three-Ways)
   Comprehensive Webscraping using Regex, Selenium, BeautifulSoup to download financial data into workable dataframes.
    I built three data pipelines for diversely formatted sites to compile stock market data via [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), with an emphasis on practicing my regex syntax.

### Conclusion
    In all my projects, the goal is simply _to see_. Amongst an inordinate amount of KPIs, I want to identify the disproportionately valuable ones which drive the greatest impact. Usually, they are the ones that get the most pushback cross-departments, because they are the most difficult and stubborn KPIs to move. 
    I like to lay groundwork by learning from and interviewing subject-matter experts to get a clear definition of the business problem. Data then becomes my solutions book. I spend most of my time iterating, incrementally improving, and applying some creativity to the answer. I love having _Aha_ moments throughout the process. 
    The beauty of data is that it is falseless and fair (the truth). How well data can help businesses grow depends solely on its application.</p>
