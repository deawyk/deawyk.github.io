I generally spend 1-2 weeks working on each project. (My bandwidth for long-term projects is strictly reserved for work). The ideation process is spontaneous, usually when personal interest, time, and an learning opportunity align.

I veer toward people problems that often deal with vague, dense subjects, present indefinite answers, and sometimes even more questions. Through the process I've become more comfortable with ambiguity.

## [People & Talent Analytics](https://github.com/deawyk/HR-Analytics/blob/main/Geolocation%20Clustering%20Lesson%20Plan.ipynb)
**A 3-day lesson plan that combines all the widely used tools (Excel, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook) on the market and introduces students to HR Analytics and its applications.**

    
## [Talent Migration and Time Series Forecasting](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dea.wang/viz/WorldBankLinkedInInsights/StoryInsights)
**Storytelling through data. A storyboard that explains the past and present talent migration across countries, industries, and skillsets/expertise, and forecasts them for the next 5 years using Holt Exponential Smoothing (annual data means no presence of seasonality).**

## [Automated Trading System with APIs](https://github.com/deawyk/Automated-Trading-System-via-APIs/blob/main/automated%20trading%20tda%20api.py)
**A trading bot that trades stocks for you using TD Ameritrade API in Python.**
    
I wrote multiple Classes for trading actions using [tda-api](https://pypi.org/project/tda-api/). The stock, trading interval, and investment strategy of choice is user-determined. In the example, I used RSI or EMA thresholds ([ta](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for financial ratios) to trigger actions. Process was automated end-to-end with Selenium.<br>

## [Customer Segmentation via Heurisitics and ML](https://github.com/deawyk/Customer-Segmentation-via-KMeans/blob/main/CS_KMeans.ipynb)
**Customer segmentation and cohort analysis on real retail data using heuristics and k-means clustering.**

Customer segmentation and cohort analysis of real retail data using brute force, heuristic, and machine learning approaches.

I performed EDA on 525k records from an UK based eCommerce store, converted prices dynamically based on fx rate at time of purchase ([cc](https://pypi.org/project/CurrencyConverter/)), grouped cohorts, and conducted behavioural analysis. My heuristic approach (RFM quartile) was analyzed against results from k-means clustering, revealing 69% congruency.<br>

## [Google Cloud Platform ETL and BI](https://github.com/deawyk/Google-Analytics-KPIs-via-Google-BigQuery/blob/main/BigQuery%20Script.sql)
**Comprehensive report and three dashboards outlining high-level, ad-hoc, and KPI needs, using tools from Google.**
    
I wrote queries for metrics such as total pageviews, unique pageviews, entrances, exits, time on page, bounces, and more, to identify the disproportionately valuable KPIs which could drive the biggest impact.<br>

[Google Merchandise Store Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/gms_16221492319430/1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## [Webscraping Three Ways](https://github.com/deawyk/Webscraping-Three-Ways/blob/main/pipeline.py)
**Using Regex, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup, built data pipelines for three diversely formatted sites to compile financial data ([yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)) into workable dataframes, with emphasis on Regex.
