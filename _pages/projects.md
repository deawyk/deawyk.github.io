I typically spend ~1-2 weeks on personal projects. (My bandwidth for longer projects is strictly reserved for work). The ideation process is spontaneous, usually when curiosity and a learning opportunity align.

I veer toward people/customer-focused problems that often deal with dense subjects and vague answers. Through the process I've learnt to appreciate the grind through the ambiguity.

## [Automated Trading System with APIs](https://github.com/deawyk/Automated-Trading-System-via-APIs/blob/main/automated%20trading%20tda%20api.py)
**A trading bot that trades stocks for you using TD Ameritrade API in Python.**
    
I wrote multiple Classes for trading actions using [tda-api](https://pypi.org/project/tda-api/). The stock, trading interval, and investment strategy of choice is user-determined. In the example, I used RSI or EMA thresholds ([ta](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for financial ratios) to trigger actions. Process was automated end-to-end with Selenium.<br>

## [Customer Segmentation via Heurisitics and ML](https://github.com/deawyk/Customer-Segmentation-via-KMeans/blob/main/CS_KMeans.ipynb)
**Customer segmentation and cohort analysis on real retail data using heuristics and k-means clustering.**
    
I performed EDA on 525k records from an UK based eCommerce store, converted prices dynamically based on fx rate at time of purchase ([cc](https://pypi.org/project/CurrencyConverter/)), grouped cohorts, and conducted behavioural analysis. My heuristic approach (RFM quartile) was analyzed against results from k-means clustering, revealing 69% congruency.<br>

## [Google Cloud Platform ETL and BI](https://github.com/deawyk/Google-Analytics-KPIs-via-Google-BigQuery/blob/main/BigQuery%20Script.sql)
**Comprehensive report and three dashboards outlining high-level, ad-hoc, and KPI needs, using tools from Google.**
    
I wrote queries for metrics such as total pageviews, unique pageviews, entrances, exits, time on page, bounces, and more, to identify the disproportionately valuable KPIs which could drive the biggest impact.<br>

## [Webscraping Three Ways](https://github.com/deawyk/Webscraping-Three-Ways/blob/main/pipeline.py)
**Using Regex, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup, built data pipelines for three diversely formatted sites to compile financial data ([yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)) into workable dataframes, with emphasis on regex.**
