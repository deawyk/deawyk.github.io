I generally spend 1-2 weeks working on each project. (My bandwidth for long-term projects is strictly reserved for work). The ideation process is spontaneous, usually when personal interest, time, and an learning opportunity align.

I veer toward human problems that often deal with dense, ambiguous subjects; and present indefinite answers and sometimes even more questions. It's made me more comfortable with uncertainty.

## [Automated Trading System with APIs](https://github.com/deawyk/Automated-Trading-System-via-APIs/blob/main/automated%20trading%20tda%20api.py)
**A trading bot that trades stocks for you using TD Ameritrade API in Python.**
    
I wrote multiple Classes for trading actions using [tda-api](https://pypi.org/project/tda-api/). The stock, trading interval, and investment strategy of choice is user-determined. In the example, I used RSI or EMA thresholds ([ta](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for financial ratios) to trigger actions. Process was automated end-to-end with Selenium.

## [Customer Segmentation with Heurisitics and K-means](https://github.com/deawyk/Customer-Segmentation-via-KMeans/blob/main/CS_KMeans.ipynb)
**Customer segmentation and cohort analysis on real retail data using k-means clustering.**
    
I performed EDA of 500k records of retail data from an UK based online store, converted prices dynamically based on fx rate at time of purchase ([cc](https://pypi.org/project/CurrencyConverter/)), grouped cohorts, and conducted behavioural analysis. My heuristic approach using RFM segmentation was analyzed against results from k-means clustering, revealing 69% congruence.<br>

## [Google Cloud Platform ETL and BI](https://github.com/deawyk/Google-Analytics-KPIs-via-Google-BigQuery/blob/main/BigQuery%20Script.sql)
**Report and three dashboards outlining high-level, ad-hoc, and KPI needs.**
    
Amongst an inordinate amount of KPIs, I identified the disproportionately valuable ones which drive the biggest impact. Using Google BigQuery and Google Analytics Sample data, I wrote SQL-like queries for the metrics: Total Pageviews, Total Unique Pageviews, Total Entrances, Total Exits, Total Time on Page, Total Sessions, and Total Bounces.<br>

## [Webscraping Three Ways](https://github.com/deawyk/Webscraping-Three-Ways/blob/main/pipeline.py)
**Built pipelines for three diversely formatted websites using regex, Selenium, BeautifulSoup respectively to compile financial data ([yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)) into workable dataframes, with emphasis on regex.
