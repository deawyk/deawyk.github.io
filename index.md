Hello and welcome! <br> I'm a full-stack data analyst and Tableau jedi with industry experience in CRM data analysis and workflow optimization. I like tinkering with cool libraries like these: [pycmc](https://pypi.org/project/pycmc/) [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), and analytics websites like these: [visualcapitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com) [538](fivethirtyeight.com) [chartmetric](https://www.chartmetric.com/)

My object is to design fast and hopefully provably optimal or robust solutions to yield clairvoyance for decision making. I enjoy clearly articulated stories and codes, and continue to add to my mathematically rich background. Please feel free to reach out, I'm always happy to learn!
