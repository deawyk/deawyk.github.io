Hello! I'm Dea, a Data Science Consultant specializing in Human Capital/People. Basically, I help people focus on higher value work and make "work" more enjoyable. 

In my downtime, I read, tinker with new ideas, and sometimes [write them down](https://deaw.medium.com/). <br>
    
Here are some of my favourite hubs for open data: [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), [Chartmetric](https://www.chartmetric.com/music-industry-trends/6mo-report), [Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/); 

and my favourite essays: [Self-Optimization](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour), [The High Is Always the Pain](https://themorningnews.org/article/the-high-is-always-the-pain-and-the-pain-is-always-the-high), [How to Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html).

Feel free to reach out or [chat with me!](https://calendly.com/deaw/coffee)
