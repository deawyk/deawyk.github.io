Welcome! I'm Dea, an People Analytics Lead and Researcher, currently based in Toronto. Essentially, I help organizations help their people succeed. 

In my downtime, I read, tinker with new ideas, and sometimes [write them down](https://deaw.medium.com/). <br>
    
Here are some of my favorite hubs for open data: [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), [Chartmetric](https://www.chartmetric.com/music-industry-trends/6mo-report), [Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets),

and favorite essays: [The Ideal Woman](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour), [The High is Always the Pain](https://themorningnews.org/article/the-high-is-always-the-pain-and-the-pain-is-always-the-high), [How to Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html).
    
My inbox is always open if you're interested to [chat](https://calendly.com/deaw/coffee)!
