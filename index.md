Hello and hi! I'm a full-stack data analyst and Tableau enthusiast working on modern porfolio theory and workflow optimization. I relax by tinkering with [Yahoo! Finance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) and [Chart Metric](https://www.chartmetric.com/). 

My object is to design fast and hopefully provably optimal solutions to yield clairvoyance for decision making. I like to tell clearly articulated stories and write those same codes, and continue to add to my mathematically rich background. Please feel free to reach out, I'm always open to learn!
