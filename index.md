Hi and welcome! 
I'm a full-stack Product and Business Analyst with industry experience in real estate & infrastructure and media.

My object is to yield clairvoyance in decision making and I work to find these provably optimal solutions. At night, I read, tinker with new ideas, and [write them down](https://deaw.medium.com/). <br>
    
My favourite sources for open data: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/studies-and-reports/industries), [CBRE](https://www.cbre.ca/en/research-and-reports), [Chartmetric](https://www.chartmetric.com/music-industry-trends/6mo-report), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), [VC](https://www.visualcapitalist.com).

My favourite pieces of writing: [Self-Optimization](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour), [The High Is Always the Pain and the Pain Is Always the High](https://themorningnews.org/article/the-high-is-always-the-pain-and-the-pain-is-always-the-high), [How to Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html).
    
    
    
Help me on my quest of meeting 52 new people this year [here](https://calendly.com/deaw/coffee)!
