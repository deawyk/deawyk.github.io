Hi and welcome! 

I'm a full-stack Data and Business Analyst with industry experience in real estate & infrastructure and media.

By day, I design fast and hopefully provably optimal or robust solutions to yield clairvoyance in decision making. By night, I find new ideas to ticker with and write about them. <br>
    
My favorite sources for inspirations are [Statista](https://www.statista.com/studies-and-reports/industries), [CBRE](https://www.cbre.ca/en/research-and-reports), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), [Chartmetric](https://www.chartmetric.com/music-industry-trends/6mo-report), and [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com).

I enjoy clearly articulated stories and codes, and continue to add to my technical tool belt. Always happy to learn and [Connect](https://calendly.com/deaw/coffee)!
