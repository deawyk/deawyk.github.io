Hello and welcome! I'm a full-stack Data and Business Analyst with industry experience in real estate & infrastructure and media. My most visited resources for tinkering and inspiring are [Statista](https://www.statista.com/studies-and-reports/industries), [CBRE](https://www.cbre.ca/en/research-and-reports), & [vc](https://www.visualcapitalist.com), and [Chartmetric](https://www.chartmetric.com/music-industry-trends/6mo-report).

My object is to design fast and hopefully provably optimal or robust solutions to yield clairvoyance for decision making. I enjoy clearly articulated stories and codes, and continue to add to my mathematically rich background. Always happy to learn and [connect](https://calendly.com/deaw/coffee)!
